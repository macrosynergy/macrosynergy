The Macrosynergy package is a Python package that provides classes and functions for the 
analysis and transformation of quantamental indicators, i.e., daily time series of 
information states across multiple markets or countries. The package further offers 
methods for developing and testing macro-quantamental signals with respect to their 
predictive power and PnL generation. Principally, the functions can also be applied to 
market and alternative data at daily frequencies.
