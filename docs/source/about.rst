Macrosynergy is the global leader in macro-quantamental investment technology. Macro
quantamental indicators capture the information state of the market with respect to
macroeconomic activity, balance sheets and sentiment. Quantamental indicators can add
tremendous value to macro trading strategies, especially when combined with market price
information.

The Macrosynergy package is a Python package that provides convenience functions for the
analysis and transformation of quantamental indicators across many countries. It also
offers some basic methods for testing the trading or investment value of quantamental
strategies.
