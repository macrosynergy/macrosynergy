FAQs and Troubleshooting
========================

I am having trouble connecting to DataQuery using the API
---------------------------------------------------------

For the most common issues, such as incorrect credentials, invalid
certificates etc, the package will raise an exception with a helpful
error message.

If you find that the package raises an
``HTTPConnection``/``HTTPSConnectionPool`` error, please check your
proxy settings. In scenarios where an error is raised while running
``check_connection()`` (or another download), the error is raised with
context to the OAuth token request (to
“https://authe.jpmchase.com/as/token.oauth2”).

You would most likely need to pass your proxy settings to the
``JPMaQSDownload`` object, as shown in the `Connecting via a proxy
server <#connecting-via-a-proxy-server>`__ section. If you are accessing
DataQuery from an institutional/enterprise network, please contact your
IT department to ensure that you have the correct proxy settings.

For organizations using ZScaler - you may have to manually add the
ZScaler certificates to the ``certifi`` certificate store (typically
called ``cacert.pem``). You can find the location of the ``certifi``
certificate store by running the following in your Python environment:

.. code:: python

   import certifi
   print(certifi.where())

Here’s a link to `ZScaler’s official documentation and
FAQs <https://help.zscaler.com/zia/adding-custom-certificate-application-specific-trust-store>`__
on how to add certificates to application specific trust stores.
