What is the Academy?
--------------------

Quantamental System or ‘JPMaQS’. Access to JPMaQS macro quantamental
indicators requires a licence from J.P. Morgan and is subject to
separate terms and conditions provided by J.P. Morgan.

The Macrosynergy package and the Academy are designed designed to be
used in conjunction with the JPMaQS Quantamental System. However, if you
do not have access to JPMaQS, you can use the free data sets on Kaggle
`here <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/macrosynergy/fixed-income-returns-and-macro-trends>`__.
You can also use the Academy with simulated data from
`macrosynergy.management.simulate <./macrosynergy.management.simulate.md>`__.
