# Contribution Guide

## Introduction

The Macrosynergy package is an open-source project. We welcome contributions of all kinds,
from simple bug reports through to new features and documentation improvements.
This document outlines the process for contributing to the project.

## Raising an Issue

If you have found a bug or have a question about the package, please raise an
issue on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/macrosynergy/macrosynergy/issues/new/choose).

If you are reporting a bug, please include as much information as possible to help us
reproduce the issue. This includes environment details (e.g. operating system, Python version,
dependency versions (`pip freeze`)) error messages, and a minimal reproducible example.

## Feature Requests

A new feature is a substantial change to the package that adds new functionality.
New features can be discussed in a [Feature Request issue](https://github.com/macrosynergy/macrosynergy/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=)
on the issues tracker.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The package has the 3 primary branches:

- `develop`: The development branch; used for development and testing of new features
- `test`: The test branch; used for testing and release candidates
- `main`: The main branch; used for stable releases

```
develop ← feature/<feature_name>
        ← bugfix/<bugfix_name>
        
test ← develop

main ← hotfix/<hotfix_name>
     ← test  

...
develop ← version++ ← main
```


### New Features

Adding a new feature or enhancement requires a new feature branch to be created
from the `develop` branch. The feature branch should be named

```
develop ← feature/<feature_name>
```

Once the feature is complete, a pull request should be raised against the `develop`
branch. See the [Pull Requests Section](#pull-requests) for more details.

### Bugfixes

Bugfixes also be made against the `develop` branch.

```
develop ← bugfix/<bugfix_name>
```

### Hotfixes

Hotfixes are reserved for critical bugfixes that need to be deployed immediately.
These are typically reserved for security issues, build process bugs, or issues
with business-critical functionality. Hotfixes should be made against the `main` branch. Once PR is merged, the `main` branch should be merged into the `develop` branch; and a new release should be created from the `main` branch.

**The hotfix must also contain a version increment to allow for the new release.**
```
main ← hotfix/<hotfix_name>
```


### CI/CD related changes

For changes related to build processes, CI/CD, or other maintenance tasks:
```
chore/<chore_name>
```
Make sure to use "Chore" as the type of the pull request. (See [Pull Requests/Title Conventions](#title-conventions))
## Pull Requests

### Pull Request Process

All pull requests (PR) must be made against the `develop` branch of the repository. All PRs require
at least one review from a maintainer before they can be merged.
The pull requests require status checks to pass before they can be merged.

### Status Checks

The following status checks are run on all pull requests:

- All unit tests must pass
- All integration tests must pass
- Code coverage must be at least 50%. For community contributions, this is checked by the maintainer.

### Title Conventions

Titles for pull requests should be of the form:

**\<Type>: Clear description with `code_formatted` correctly**

Where **\<Type>** is one of:

- `Feature`: For new features
- `Bugfix`: For bug fixes
- `Hotfix`: For hotfixes
- `Chore`: Reserved for CI/CD and other maintenance tasks
