Macrosynergy is the global leader in macro-quantamental investment technology.  Macro 
quantamental indicators capture the information state of the market with respect to 
macroeconomic activity, balance sheets and sentiment. Quantamental indicators can add 
tremendous value to macro trading strategies, especially when combined with market price 
information. 

The Macrosynery package is a Python package that provides convenience functions for the
analysis and transformation of quantamental indicators across many countries. It also 
offers some basic methods for testing the trading or investment value of quantamental 
strategies.
