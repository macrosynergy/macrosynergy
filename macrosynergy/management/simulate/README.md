# `macrosynergy.management.simulate`

## Description

The `macrosynergy.management.simulate` subpackage provides utilities for simulating data for use with the `macrosynergy` package. This functionality extends the use of the package to allow users to test/develop code without access to the J.P. Morgan DataQuery API. It is also helpful for users auditing the package, or for users who want to test the package or academy without a JPMaQS licence.
